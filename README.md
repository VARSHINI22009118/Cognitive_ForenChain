## 🚀 Overview

Cognitive ForenChain is an advanced digital forensic investigation platform that integrates **Brain–Computer Interface (BCI), Cyber Security orchestration, Digital Forensics processing, Cloud computing infrastructure, and Blockchain smart contracts** into a unified secure ecosystem.

The system introduces cognitive-driven forensic workflows where simulated EEG-based inputs trigger investigative actions. All forensic operations are securely processed through a centralized Cyber Security Platform, analyzed by a Digital Forensics Engine, and immutably recorded on a blockchain ledger to preserve chain-of-custody integrity.

This ensures:

- 🔐 Evidence integrity  
- ⛓ Tamper-proof logging  
- ☁ Cloud-based scalability  
- 🧠 Intelligent forensic interaction  
- ⚖ Legal reliability and audit transparency

## ✨ Key Features

- **🧠 Cognitive Command Processing**  
  Simulated EEG signals are decoded into actionable forensic commands such as evidence tagging and anomaly detection.

- **☁ Cloud-Based Forensic Processing**  
  Scalable infrastructure supports real-time log analysis, threat detection, and distributed forensic computation.

- **🔍 Automated Digital Forensics Engine**  
  Performs evidence acquisition, hashing (SHA-256), timeline reconstruction, malware analysis, and metadata inspection.

- **⛓ Blockchain-Powered Chain of Custody**  
  Every forensic action is immutably recorded on a permissioned blockchain ledger.

- **📜 Smart Contract-Based Access Control**  
  Role-based authorization ensures only verified investigators can access or modify evidence.

- **📊 Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard**  
  Web-based application interface displaying system health, forensic status, and blockchain transactions.

## 🧩 System Architecture

The system consists of four integrated modules:

### 1️⃣ Brain–Computer Interface (BCI)
- Captures simulated EEG-based cognitive inputs.
- Decodes mental commands into structured system actions.
- Sends decoded commands to the Cyber Security Platform.

### 2️⃣ Cyber Security Platform (CSP)
- Central orchestration engine.
- Processes cognitive commands.
- Coordinates forensic operations.
- Generates alerts and system logs.

### 3️⃣ Digital Forensics Module (DFM)
- Acquires digital evidence.
- Generates cryptographic hashes (SHA-256).
- Performs malware detection and anomaly analysis.
- Produces structured forensic reports.

### 4️⃣ Blockchain & Smart Contracts
- Records all forensic transactions.
- Maintains immutable audit logs.
- Enforces role-based access permissions.
- Preserves legally valid chain-of-custody.
