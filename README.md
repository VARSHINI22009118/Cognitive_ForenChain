Cognitive ForenChain
Cloud-Integrated Cognitive Blockchain-Based Digital Forensics System

Empowering digital investigations with cognitive intelligence, cloud scalability, and tamper-proof blockchain security.

🚀 Overview

Cognitive ForenChain is a next-generation digital forensic investigation platform that integrates Brain–Computer Interface (BCI), Cyber Security orchestration, Digital Forensics processing, Cloud infrastructure, and Blockchain smart contracts to create a secure, intelligent, and legally trustworthy forensic ecosystem.

The system enables cognitive-driven forensic actions, scalable cloud-based analysis, and immutable blockchain-based chain-of-custody logging to ensure transparency, integrity, and compliance.

✨ Key Features

🧠 Cognitive Command Processing
Simulated EEG-based inputs allow intelligent evidence tagging and anomaly detection.

☁ Cloud-Based Forensic Processing
Scalable infrastructure for log analysis, malware detection, and forensic report generation.

🔍 Automated Digital Forensics Engine
Performs evidence acquisition, hashing, tagging, timeline reconstruction, and anomaly analysis.

⛓ Blockchain-Powered Chain of Custody
All forensic actions are immutably recorded on a permissioned blockchain ledger.

📜 Smart Contract-Based Access Control
Role-based access management and automatic verification of forensic operations.

📊 Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard
Web-based UI for investigation tracking and system status visualization.

🧩 System Architecture

The system consists of four primary modules:

Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) Module

Captures cognitive signals (simulated EEG inputs)

Converts mental commands into system-triggered forensic actions

Cyber Security Platform (CSP)

Acts as central orchestration engine

Coordinates forensic tasks

Handles alerts and system monitoring

Digital Forensics Module (DFM)

Evidence acquisition

Hash generation (SHA-256)

Malware detection

Evidence tagging and reporting

Blockchain + Smart Contracts

Records forensic transactions

Maintains immutable audit logs

Enforces role-based access control

Preserves legally valid chain of custody

🛠 Tech Stack

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.11+ (64-bit)

Node.js

MySQL

MetaMask

Hardhat

VS Code

🔹 Backend Setup

Navigate to backend folder:

cd backend


Install dependencies:

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt


Start backend server:

python app.py

🔹 Smart Contract Deployment

Start local blockchain:

npx hardhat node


Deploy contracts:

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

🔹 Frontend Setup
cd client
npm install
npm start

🎯 Usage
🧠 Cognitive Input Processing

Simulated EEG command entered

System decodes command

Command sent to Cyber Security Platform

🔍 Evidence Analysis

Evidence file uploaded

Hash generated

Analysis performed

Evidence tagged as safe/suspicious

⛓ Blockchain Logging

Forensic action recorded

Smart contract verifies access

Transaction hash generated

🔒 Security Considerations

Immutability:
All forensic logs are stored on blockchain and cannot be altered.

Access Control:
Smart contracts enforce role-based permissions.

Data Integrity:
Evidence is hashed before storage to ensure authenticity.

Audit Transparency:
Every forensic action is time-stamped and verifiable.
